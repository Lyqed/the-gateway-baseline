# Design brief — thegatewaybaseline.com & opensourcegateway.com

*The binding art direction for both sites. Derived from one photograph: the
Astra launch-site atrium — a rocket standing in a white circular gallery,
hard skylight geometry on brushed metal, and hand-painted murals bleeding
across the clean walls. Two sites, one design system, two temperaments.*

## 1. The direction, named

**Machined precision × hand-painted humanity.** Not "space aesthetic." The
photo's power is the collision: white curved architecture, perforated steel,
hard-edged sunlight — interrupted by murals a person painted by hand (an
astronaut holding a flower, a monarch butterfly, planets in saturated
splashes). The web translation:

- The *engineering layer* — layout, typography, data, the matrix — is
  precise, gridded, light, unornamented. It earns trust the way the spec
  does: by being exact.
- The *human layer* — hand-drawn SVG strokes, painted color fields, script
  annotations — deliberately breaks that grid at chosen moments. It is why
  anyone cares: people build this.

Neither layer is decoration for the other. The rule: **every painted element
annotates something real** (a principle, a check, a milestone), and **every
precise element could survive without the paint**.

And beneath both, a third register, used sparingly: **Kubrick stillness.**
The photo is one frame from *2001* — a machine built to leave Earth standing
silent in a white circular room, dwarfed by its own architecture. At a few
chosen moments each site goes still: perfect one-point symmetry, vast
negative space, and one deadpan sentence from the spec, alone. No paint, no
reassurance, no CTA. The existential note is quiet and earned — this
infrastructure watches, counts, and remembers, and somebody is responsible
for it. It must never tip into sci-fi theater; it is the silence between the
two louder layers.

This is light-first by conviction — the atrium is daylight. `color-scheme:
light`, no dark mode in v1. The single dark surface is the polished-floor
footer.

## 2. Tokens (copy verbatim into both sites)

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light;

  /* Architecture */
  --surface-atrium: oklch(97.5% 0.004 95);   /* warm gallery white — page ground */
  --surface-panel: oklch(94.5% 0.005 250);   /* cool panel white — cards, wells */
  --steel: oklch(76% 0.01 250);              /* brushed rail — borders, rules */
  --steel-dark: oklch(52% 0.014 255);        /* fixture gray — secondary text */
  --floor: oklch(21% 0.012 270);             /* polished dark floor — footer, dark band */
  --ink: oklch(19% 0.016 270);               /* primary text */

  /* Murals (semantic, never decorative-only) */
  --monarch: oklch(69% 0.185 55);            /* monarch orange — leadership, emphasis, CTAs */
  --violet: oklch(54% 0.21 300);             /* mural violet — the human layer: annotations, community */
  --teal: oklch(64% 0.115 195);              /* sky teal — conformance, verified, success */
  --gold: oklch(80% 0.15 90);                /* sun gold — partial, in-progress, caution */
  --skylight: oklch(63% 0.14 250);           /* skylight blue — links, interactive */
  --blossom: oklch(58% 0.2 25);              /* blossom red — missing, errors, hard stops */

  /* Type scale */
  --text-base: clamp(1rem, 0.94rem + 0.3vw, 1.125rem);
  --text-hero: clamp(2.75rem, 1.2rem + 6.5vw, 7rem);
  --text-section: clamp(1.75rem, 1.2rem + 2.2vw, 3rem);

  /* Rhythm */
  --space-section: clamp(5rem, 3.5rem + 6vw, 11rem);

  /* Motion */
  --duration-fast: 150ms;
  --duration-normal: 320ms;
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
```

Semantic mapping is binding: teal = conforms/verified, gold = partial/in
progress, blossom = missing/error, monarch = leader/emphasis/primary action,
violet = human voice (annotations, community, contribution), skylight =
links. Never swap these roles.

## 3. Typography

Three families, each a voice — the third is the exception the concept pays
for (subset, loaded only where used):

| Family | Voice | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Space Grotesk** (`next/font/google`) | the machined voice | display, headings, UI, body |
| **IBM Plex Mono** | the instrument voice | GB codes, data cells, dates, spec clauses, commit refs |
| **Shantell Sans** | the mural voice | hand annotations only — 4-8 instances per page, never body text, never navigation |

Display headlines set tight (`letter-spacing: -0.03em`, `line-height: 0.95`),
often uppercase for single words, mixed-case for sentences. Mono always at
smaller optical sizes with `letter-spacing: 0.02em`. Shantell in violet (or
monarch on dark), rotated −2° to +3°, positioned like margin notes.

## 4. The visual vocabulary

Recurring, reusable, restrained. Build each once as a component/SVG, reuse.

**Architecture (the grid's own ornament):**
- *Skylight bands* — hard-edged diagonal light: low-opacity linear-gradient
  stripes clipped at 18-24°, laid across white sections. Light, not lines.
- *Perforated rail* — SVG dot-grid texture band (the mesh railing), used as
  section dividers or card texture at ≤6% opacity.
- *The ring* — large circular outline elements (the circular gallery): a
  ring cropped by the viewport behind hero content, ring-segment dividers.
- *Polished floor* — the footer: `--floor` background with a faint vertical
  reflection gradient of the content above it.

**Murals (the hand's vocabulary — organic, saturated, grid-breaking):**
- *Brush fields* — irregular painted color blobs (SVG paths, 2-3 layered
  tones of one mural color) sitting **behind** or **bleeding across** a
  section edge; never perfectly rounded, never symmetric.
- *Orbit arcs* — thin hand-wobbled arcs with a small planet dot, crossing a
  section corner.
- *The monarch* — one butterfly SVG (hand-drawn path quality, monarch +
  floor-dark), used at most once per site, at the moment of transformation
  (the Baseline's "verified" moment; the Project's "contribute" moment).
- *Hand strokes* — circle-an-item ellipses, underline swashes, connector
  arrows; stroke-drawn (`stroke-dasharray` reveal on scroll), 2-3px, violet.
- *Spark marks* — tiny 4-point hand stars, sparse.

**Stillness (the Kubrick register — the third voice, rarest of all):**
- *Monolith bands* — full-bleed interstitial sections between major
  chapters: a single flat surface (`--floor` dark, or bare `--surface-atrium`),
  functionally empty, with one sentence of mono type perfectly centered on
  both axes. The sentence is always a real axiom from the spec or the
  principles, stated deadpan: "The gateway never just believes a tag." /
  "Someone is told when a cap is hit." / "If it breaks, you are
  responsible." Max two per site. Wide letter-spacing (0.08em+), small
  optical size against enormous space — the scale imbalance *is* the
  content.
- *The watching dot* — exactly once per site, inside one monolith band: a
  single small filled circle, perfectly centered above or below the
  sentence (`--monarch` on dark, `--blossom` on light). It is the alert
  that fires, the counter that runs — the system's unblinking eye. No
  animation beyond an optional slow (4s+) opacity breath, disabled under
  reduced motion. Never explained in copy.
- *Symmetry discipline* — monolith bands are strict one-point-perspective
  compositions (everything centered, generous identical margins), in
  deliberate contrast to the asymmetric editorial grid everywhere else.
  The snap into symmetry is what makes them uncanny; if the rest of the
  page were symmetric too, the effect dies.

Anti-kitsch rules: murals appear at **section boundaries and annotations**,
never as page-wide wallpaper; at most two mural moments per viewport; body
text never sits on paint; paint never carries information alone (a11y).
Stillness rules: monolith bands contain no paint, no links, no more than
one sentence; a monolith band and a mural moment never share a viewport —
stillness must be empty to work; never use HAL-red literally as a glowing
eye with lens-flare theatrics — a flat dot, nothing more.

## 5. Motion

Motion clarifies the three registers: the machined layer moves with
precision (fades, small translates, `--ease-out-expo`), the hand layer
*draws itself* (SVG stroke-dash reveals, 600-900ms), and the stillness
layer barely moves at all — monolith bands fade in slowly (1200ms, linear,
Kubrick pacing) and their sentence does not translate, only appears. IntersectionObserver-triggered,
compositor-friendly properties only, all gated behind
`prefers-reduced-motion` (reduced = everything visible, nothing animates).
Hover states: cards lift 2px with a hard-edged shadow shifting like
sunlight (offset shadow, not blur); links get a hand-underline swash on
hover where affordable, plain underline otherwise.

## 6. Shared skeleton

Both sites: Next.js 16.2.7 / React 19 / Tailwind v4 / TypeScript / pnpm —
the exact toolchain of antonbraverman.com (copy its config lineage:
`next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, eslint). Standard
files: `layout.tsx` with skip link, semantic landmarks, `robots.ts`,
`sitemap.ts`, `icon.svg`, per-page metadata. Static prerender everything.
Performance budget: landing < 150kb JS gzipped — these are content sites;
ship close to zero client JS (IntersectionObserver reveals only).
Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast on all text (steel-dark on atrium passes;
verify every mural-color-on-white pairing ≥ 4.5:1 for text, or reserve for
non-text), keyboard-visible focus (2px monarch outline, offset 2px).

## 7. Site A — thegatewaybaseline.com

**Brand: "The Gateway Baseline." Temperament: the instrument.** 80%
machined / 20% mural. This is the neutral yardstick — it must read as a
spec, not a pitch. The paint here is *annotation*: the hand pointing at
what matters.

Single page, anchored nav (`Checks · Matrix · Method · History`), sections:

1. **Hero** — the ring motif behind; "The Gateway Baseline" in display
   caps; subline: nine checks a platform team can hold any LLM gateway to,
   verified against public documentation. One hand annotation: violet
   stroke circling the word "verified", Shantell note "*not vendor claims*".
   GB-1..GB-9 as a mono chip row.
2. **The nine checks** — the spec. One card per check: mono `GB-n` code,
   plain-language title, requirement text (MUST language), conformance
   note. Data ported **faithfully** from
   `/home/lyqed/website/src/lib/gateways.ts` (CRITERIA) — same words, no
   invention. Layout: editorial two-column rhythm, not a uniform card grid;
   GB-9 (the aspirational ninth) visually distinct (gold left rule +
   Shantell "*entered 14 July 2026 — awaits verification*").
3. **The matrix** — the heart. Port `GATEWAYS` cell data faithfully:
   8 gateways × 9 checks, sticky gateway column, mono cells; teal filled
   dot = conforms, gold half dot = partial, blossom open dot = missing,
   steel dash = not verified. Leader rows get a monarch "Leading" tint.
   Mobile: the existing dot-strip pattern. Every cell's note text available
   (details disclosure or title). Legend up front. The monarch butterfly
   sits at this section's edge — transformation happens here.
3b. **Monolith band** (after the matrix, before Method) — floor-dark,
   centered mono: "The gateway never just believes a tag." The watching
   dot sits above the sentence (monarch on dark). This is the site's
   still point: the matrix shouts with data, then the room goes quiet.
4. **Method** — how cells get verified (public docs only, dated snapshots,
   corrections via email), short and exact. Include the correction contact.
5. **Spec history** — `SPEC_HISTORY` dated entries as a mono timeline with
   ring-segment markers.
5b. **Monolith band** (before the reference-implementation section) — bare
   atrium white this time, centered mono: "Someone is told when a cap is
   hit." No dot (it was spent in 3b), no other content.
6. **Reference implementation** — one restrained cross-link band: "A
   community gateway is being built against this bar" → opensourcegateway.com
   (+ github.com/Lyqed/thegatewayproject).
7. **Footer** — polished floor: dark band, mono small print, sister-site
   link, "Verified cells, not marketing pages" as the standing line.

## 8. Site B — opensourcegateway.com

**Brand headline: "The Open Source Gateway" (the project's working name,
"The Gateway Project", appears in copy; final naming is an open decision —
docs/04 names the collision risk). Temperament: the mural.** 60% machined /
40% mural — this is the community site; the human layer leads. Same tokens,
same vocabulary, more paint: brush fields larger, annotations more frequent
(within the anti-kitsch caps).

Single page, anchored nav (`Principles · Architecture · Build · Contribute`):

1. **Hero** — brush field bleeding from the left edge behind the ring; "The
   Open Source Gateway" display; subline: a gateway platform teams build,
   own, and answer for — measured by the Gateway Baseline, in the open.
   Two CTAs: "Read the design docs" (monarch, → GitHub repo), "See the
   Baseline" (outline, → thegatewaybaseline.com).
2. **Principles** — three walls, each a panel with one hand annotation:
   *Two binaries plus Git* (the whole system, drawn as three hand-sketched
   boxes); *Defer, defer, defer* (Shantell: "*you don't need to buy
   anything — yet*"); *The six-month rule* (you own your change for its
   lifetime). Sourced from docs/00-principles.md — same claims, tightened
   copy.
3. **Architecture** — the canonical event stream as the centerpiece visual:
   the six events (`MessageStart → ContentDelta → ToolCallDelta →
   UsageDelta → MessageEnd / Error`) as stations on one hand-drawn line
   crossing a machined section; mono labels, violet strokes. Below, two
   compact panels: the data plane (streaming first-class, mid-stream
   enforcement) and the control plane (ArgoCD-for-gateway-fleets, Git as
   truth). Sourced from docs/02-architecture.md.
4. **Build status** — honest, dated: Phase 0 in progress; Spike A (event
   model over three wire formats — tests green) with what remains; Spike B
   (Pingora vs agentgateway) status; then the phase roadmap as a vertical
   mono timeline (from docs/04-build-plan.md). Gold = in progress, teal =
   done, steel = ahead. No invented progress.
4b. **Monolith band** (between Build status and the ownership contract) —
   floor-dark, centered mono: "It runs while you sleep." The watching dot
   below the sentence. The one still moment on a site that otherwise leads
   with the human layer — which is exactly why it lands.
5. **The ownership contract** — the mural moment (butterfly here): "If
   something breaks because of a change you made six months ago — you are
   responsible." Set large, half machined type / the key phrase circled by
   hand. Short paragraph on what that buys a community. (This section stays
   a mural moment, not a monolith — the contract is human warmth, not
   dread; the dread came one scroll earlier.)
6. **Contribute** — where to start: read the docs (repo link), the spikes,
   adapters as first contributions; violet panel.
7. **Footer** — polished floor, sister link to the Baseline, repo link.

`site-config`: name "The Open Source Gateway", url
https://opensourcegateway.com.

## 9. What both sites must NOT be

The design-quality bar, stated as bans: no dark-mode dev-tool template; no
centered-hero-gradient-blob; no uniform card grids with identical radius and
shadow; no stock feature-triplet icons; no glassmorphism; no neon-on-black
"AI" styling; no parallax theater. If a section could be screenshotted into
any SaaS landing page, redo it. The photo is the test: would this moment
belong in that atrium?
